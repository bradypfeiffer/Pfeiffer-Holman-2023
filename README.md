# Background of Space Physics
Radiation from nonlinear Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and shocks can impact satellites, crewed spacecraft, and infrastructure like power grids and pipelines by accelerating charged particles and inducing currents. Improved knowledge of these phenomena is vital for accurate space weather predictions, benefiting industry in cost-effective risk mitigation for personnel and infrastructure.

# MHD Waves and Nonlinearity
My research focused on MHD applied to the solar wind. MHD combines the Navier-Stokes and Maxwell's equations to study magnetized conducting fluids. MHD has various scientific and industrial applications, involving three wave types driven by thermal and magnetic pressure gradients. These are the slow and vast magnetoacoustic waves, and the Alfvén wave with their speeds constrained as v_S < v_I < v_F. When a parameter know as the plasma 'beta' is less than 1, the Alfvén and fast wave speeds coincide. For low beta, waves at about 20 degrees from the background magnetic field are termed 'quasiparallel.' In such cases, MHD equations simplify, leading to the derivative nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) equation, which can be solved using the inverse scattering transformation (IST). The IST reveals that the DNLS can be represented as a finite number of 'solitons.'

# Project Description
This project expanded on Dr. Hamilton's extensive numerical studies made on the dynamics of nonlinear MHD waves. It connected numerical study of the effects of dissipation, nonlinear Landau damping, and interactions with fast and intermediate shocks
